openai.ChatCompletion.create(

  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},

### role

* **system**: typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages. The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. In the example above, the assistant was instructed with "You are a helpful assistant."
* **user**: The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction. The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.
