In a world of bamboo and misty air,
Cuddly pandas roam with gentle flair.
Their fluffy fur, as white as snow,
Brings warmth and joy wherever they go.

With ebony patches on their eyes so sweet,
They capture hearts with every gentle beat.
Their playful antics, full of charm,
Invite us to hold them in our arms.

Oh, cuddly pandas, so peaceful and serene,
Your presence makes every scene so pristine.
Let's cherish these treasures, forever and a day,
For in their embrace, worries simply melt away.
