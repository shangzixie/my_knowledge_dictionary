# Throwing Errors VS try-catch

Generally speaking, errors are thrown in the low levels of an application architecture, at a level where not much is known about the ongoing process, and so the error canâ€™t really be handled. If you are writing a JavaScript library that may be used in a number of different applications, or even a utility function that will be used in a number of different places in a single application, you should strongly consider throwing errors with detailed information. It is then up to the application to catch the errors and handle them appropriately.
The best way to think about the difference between throwing errors and catching errors is this: you should catch errors only if you know exactly what to do next. The purpose of catching an error is to prevent the browser from responding in its default manner; the purpose of throwing an error is to provide information about why an error occurred.
