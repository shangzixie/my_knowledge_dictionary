# memory

## why use memoy virtualization

every address generated by a user program is a virtual address. The OS is just providing an illusion to each process, speciﬁcally that it has its own large and private memory; with
some hardware help, the OS will turn these pretend virtual addresses into real physical addresses, and thus be able to locate the desired information.

why?

1. the OS will give each program the view that it has a large contiguous address space to put its code and data into; thus, as a programmer, you never have to worry about things like “where should I store this variable?” because the virtual address space of the program is large and has lots of room for that sort of thing. Life, for a programmer, becomes much more tricky if you have to worry about ﬁtting all of your code data into a small, crowded memory.
2. **isolation and protection** are big deals, too. We don’t want one errant program to be able to read, or worse, overwrite, some other program’s memory, do we?
