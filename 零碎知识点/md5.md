# [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)

define: The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a cryptographically broken but still widely used [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) producing a 128-bit hash value.

It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. **It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining
the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database**, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms algorithms.[3]
